title: Abort Session with "x"
description: |
  A simple OpenCode plugin that lets you interrupt a running session by typing "x" in Discord.
---

## Why you need this

When an AI is generating a long response or going down the wrong path, you want to stop it **fast**. Typing `/abort` or clicking buttons takes too long. Sometimes the model is deleting files or running commands you didn't want - every second counts.

With this plugin, just type `x` and hit enter. The session stops immediately. The message isn't sent to the model, so you don't waste tokens or pollute your conversation history.

## How it works

The plugin hooks into `chat.message`, which fires when you send a message. If the message is exactly "x" (case-insensitive), it:

1. Clears the message so it's never sent to the LLM
2. Calls `session.abort()` to stop the current generation

## Installation

Kimaki supports any OpenCode plugin. Create this file at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/abort-on-x.ts`:

```ts
import type { Plugin } from '@opencode-ai/plugin'

export const AbortOnXPlugin: Plugin = async ({ client }) => ({
  'chat.message': async (input, output) => {
    const text = output.parts
      .filter((p) => p.type === 'text')
      .map((p) => (p as { text: string }).text.trim())
      .join('')

    if (text.toLowerCase() === 'x') {
      output.parts.length = 0
      await client.session.abort({ path: { id: input.sessionID } })
    }
  },
})
```

Plugins in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` load automatically on startup. No config changes needed.

## Using other OpenCode plugins

Kimaki runs on OpenCode, so any OpenCode plugin works out of the box. You can:

- **Load local plugins** by placing `.ts` or `.js` files in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` (global) or `.opencode/plugins/` (per-project)
- **Load npm plugins** by adding them to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-wakatime", "opencode-helicone-session"]
}
```
